### Installing via NPM
```bash
npm install bald-knex
```

### Getting started

Using bald is really easy, let's take the following example:

We have a table called `Users` we'd like to expose to the API:

```javascript
bald = new Bald({app: app, knex: knex})

bald.resource({
  model: 'Users'
});
```

That's it! You can now create, read, update and delete using the newly created API. You can check them at `/api/Users/` and `/api/Users/:pk` where `:pk` is the primary key of the table.

### Primary keys

Sometimes you may want to set a different primary key than `id`, for that you can set the `primaryKey` parameter in the resource initialization as follows:

```javascript
bald.resource({
  model: 'Users'
  primaryKey: 'id'
})
```

### Middleware support

Bald also optionally includes middleware support for each route that is declared:

```javascript
isLoggedIn = function(req, res, next) {
  if (req.user) {
    return next();
  } else {
    return res.end('permission-denied')
  }
};

bald.resource({
  model: model
  middleware: {
    list: [isAdmin, isLoggedIn],
    create: [isAdmin, isLoggedIn],
    read: [isLoggedIn],
    update: [isAdmin, isLoggedIn],
    delete: [isAdmin, isLoggedIn]
  }
})
```

You do not need to declare all the routes middleware if none is needed.

#### HTTP

Following the same method as in the manager, you `PUT` or `POST` the data to the endpoint with `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

### REST API

Available routes are listed below:

Method | URL | Description
-------|-----| ------------
GET | /api/Users | Displays all users
GET | /api/Users/1 | Displays a user, searched by id
PUT | /api/Users | Edits multiple users (JSON format)
PUT | /api/Users/1 | Edits a user
POST | /api/Users | Adds a user
DELETE | /api/Users/1 |Â Deletes a user

### Custom endpoints

You can declare your own endpoints instead of letting bald pluralize the model's name. In order to do so you'll have to declare the bald resource in the following way:

```javascript
bald.resource({
  model: 'User',
  endpoints: {
    plural: '/api/CoolUsers'
    singular: '/api/CoolUser/:id'
  }
});
```

Please note that the singular must include the `id` query parameter in the string. If you are specifiyign custom endpoints, both singular and plural endpoints are mandatory.
